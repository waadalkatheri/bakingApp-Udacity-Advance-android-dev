## Project Overview

##### You will productionize an app, taking it from a functional state to a production-ready state. This will involve finding and handling error cases, adding accessibility features, allowing for localization, adding a widget, and adding a library.

## Why this Project?

##### As a working Android developer, you often have to create and implement apps where you are responsible for designing and planning the steps you need to take to create a production-ready app. Unlike Popular Movies where we gave you an implementation guide, it will be up to you to figure things out for the Baking App.

##### This project shows the following functionalities:

1-Recipes in RecyclerView in linear layout(vertical orientation) when the screen is portrait and a Gridview Orientation when the device is in landscape.

2-The ingredients and the steps of the recipe in a nested scrollview. This becomes a two pane UI when in landscape mode in tablet devices. It remains a single pane in phones (no matter what the orientation is).

3-When the user changes the recipe details they want to see, the widget also changes accordingly.

4-The user can navigate between recipes through previous/next buttons.

5-The user can navigate between recipe steps when in single pane UI design.

6-There is a Idling resource test for the first loading of recipe from network and a click on an item of the RecyclerView.

7-There is a full fledged UI Test generated using Espresso Test Recorder too.
